PX4ESC Firmware
===============

# Bootloader

Currently we're using the PX4 UAVCAN bootloader.
Its sources can be found here: <https://github.com/Zubax/PX4Firmware>, branch `px4esc_bootloader`.
This repository includes a prebuilt binary (named `bootloader.bin`),
since building the bootloader from PX4 sources is no small feat.
In the future we may migrate to our own implementation.
