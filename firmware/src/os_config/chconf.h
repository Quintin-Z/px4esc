 * ChibiOS is one of the very few open source RTOS that are fully preemptible and support tickless mode.
 *
 * Fully preemptible means that the OS never disables IRQ whose priority is higher than a certain
 * pre-configured level; therefore these IRQ can be used to perform hard real time tasks with zero latency/jitter
 * imposed by the RTOS. In this application we make heavy use of this feature.
 *
 * A tickless mode is another neat feature that enables the OS to use a free-running counter with programmable
 * alarms which trigger IRQ only when needed, rather than triggering a system tick IRQ at a fixed rate even when
 * it's not needed. I won't go into detail here, this feature is well described in the documentation.
 *
 * So, we have two neat features that have a major caveat: when used together, they turn the RTOS into a fucking
 * minefield. When the RTOS configures a new deadline on the system timer, it basically performs the following
 * steps:
 *
 *  1. Read the current system timer value.
 *  2. Add the time remaining to the deadline.
 *  3. Write the result into the compare register.
 *
 * See, the timer keeps running the whole time the sequence is executed, so it is possible that by the time we
 * reach the step 3, the value obtained at the step 1 is obsolete. Obviously, the designer of the RTOS has taken
 * that into account, and put in place two safeguards:
 *
 *  - The minimum configurable delay is limited, typically to just 2 timer ticks. So if the timer increments in the
 *    process, it's fine. The minimum is defined by the configuration parameter CH_CFG_ST_TIMEDELTA.
 *
 *  - The process is protected by the critical section, which makes it quasiatomic.
 *
 * Now remember that we have hard real time IRQ that can interrupt the RTOS at any moment.
 * See the problem? Took me 2 days...
 *
 * If the OS is interrupted between the steps 1 and 3, it may configure a deadline that is already in the past.
 * The IRQ will never fire until the system timer overflows, which may take days. Until that time, the RTOS will
 * not receive any tick interrupts, which will halt a lot of its functions. For example, if a thread goes to sleep,
 * it will never wake up (until the system timer overflows). Worse yet, if a thread is locked on a non-time related
 * event, such as arrival of data via some communication interface or whatever, it will continue to function
 * correctly, blowing the developer's mind even further.
 *
 * In order to work around the problem, we use the traditional ticked mode.
